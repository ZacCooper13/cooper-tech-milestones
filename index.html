      <ol><p ><b>1.</b> ENIAC (1946) - The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, also known as ENIAC, was the world’s first general-purpose electronic computer. This early computer included memory and arithmetic. This piece of work was created and developed by John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly. At this time, it was the most powerful calculating device ever built.</p>
        <p><b>2.</b> Apple’s Macintosh (1984) - Steve Jobs launched the first Macintosh in January 1984. The Apple co-founder showcased a number of the Macintosh’s capabilities, from its ability to “talk” to a drawing application that was able to produce sophisticated images.
The computer was targeted at two primary markets. The first was to the 25 million workers who sit behind desks, and particularly  those in medium to small sized businesses. The second market was the college worker. Steve Jobs believed “that's the knowledge worker of tomorrow and there are over 11 million college students in America alone.”</p>
        <p><b> 3.</b> Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation (1994) - Launched within weeks of each other, the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation consoles blazed a trail in the video gaming industry. While the Playstation outlasted the Saturn through multiple iterations, including today’s Playstation 4&5, both consoles had a significant impact and influence on home entertainment. The consoles had enough power inside to showcase games including the visually stunning games.</p>
        <p><b>4.</b> Broadband Internet (2000s) - The 21st century has been the mass adoption of broadband internet across the developed world. Dial-up connections have become a relic of the past with users now accustomed to high-speed downloads, super-fast browsing, high resolution streaming and a great deal more. In the U.K., for example, there were 25.3 million fixed broadband connections at the end of 2016, according to communications regulator Ofcom.</p>
        <p><b>5.</b> Connected Living (2000s) - Today’s homes are rapidly transforming into spaces where traditional computers dovetail alongside newer pieces of technology, from smartphones and smart TVs to virtual assistants and tablets. With the click of a button, a song being played on a computer in someone’s bedroom can be beamed to and displayed on a 72-inch TV in their living room via a high speed, wireless connection. This merging of physical and virtual worlds is known as the internet of things.
